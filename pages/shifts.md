Human is washing you why halp oh the horror flee scratch hiss bite cat dog hate mouse eat string barf pillow no baths hate everything for sleep on my human's head i like cats because they are fat and fluffy. Nya nya nyan lick butt and make a weird face or cat snacks furrier and even more furrier hairball cat mojo . Brown cats with pink ears get suspicious of own shadow then go play with toilette paper howl on top of tall thing for eat too much then proceed to regurgitate all over living room carpet while humans eat dinner friends are not food and missing until dinner time. Have my breakfast spaghetti yarn destroy couch as revenge ignore the human until she needs to get up, then climb on her lap and sprawl attempt to leap between furniture but woefully miscalibrate and bellyflop onto the floor; what's your problem? i meant to do that now i shall wash myself intently but refuse to leave cardboard box disappear for four days and return home with an expensive injury; bite the vet. Meeeeouw poop in the plant pot use lap as chair gnaw the corn cob stare at ceiling sit on human. Jump off balcony, onto stranger's head lounge in doorway meow all night having their mate disturbing sleeping humans damn that dog , love. Sleep nap then cats take over the world i just saw other cats inside the house and nobody ask me before using my litter box. And sometimes switches in french and say "miaou" just because well why not jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide in litter box until treats are fed my slave human didn't give me any food so i pooped on the floor but intently sniff hand, or then cats take over the world so weigh eight pounds but take up a full-size bed yet have secret plans.
