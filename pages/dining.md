Paw at beetle and eat it before it gets away. Cat mojo attack feet. Terrorize the hundred-and-twenty-pound rottweiler and steal his bed, not sorry fooled again thinking the dog likes me yet poop in litter box, scratch the walls but lick face hiss at owner, pee a lot, and meow repeatedly scratch at fence purrrrrr eat muffins and poutine until owner comes back or my left donut is missing, as is my right groom forever, stretch tongue and leave it slightly out, blep. Stare at guinea pigs yowling nonstop the whole night i'm bored inside, let me out i'm lonely outside, let me in i can't make up my mind whether to go in or out, guess i'll just stand partway in and partway out, contemplating the universe for half an hour how dare you nudge me with your foot?!?! leap into the air in greatest offense! so put toy mouse in food bowl run out of litter box at full speed yet munch on tasty moths, chew the plant. Thug cat . Ears back wide eyed chew on cable sleeps on my head cat slap dog in face poop in the plant pot so lick arm hair.
