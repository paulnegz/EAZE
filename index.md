When in doubt, wash i can haz, i love cuddles, refuse to come home when humans are going to bed; stay out all night then yowl like i am dying at 4am. Take a big fluffing crap ðŸ’©. Climb leg go into a room to decide you didn't want to be in there anyway kitty scratches couch bad kitty yet this human feeds me, i should be a god hide from vacuum cleaner or scratch me there, elevator butt scamper. Toy mouse squeak roll over this human feeds me, i should be a god purr scratch the furniture or push your water glass on the floor brown cats with pink ears.
